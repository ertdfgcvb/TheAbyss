/**
 * The Abyss. 
 * A polymorphism workshop by Andreas Gysin. 
 * 2010-2011
 * I've used "The Abyss" to teach in two processing workshops for beginners and intermediate level.
 * It worked quite well so please feel free to use it for your teaching 
 * or just partecipate with your own creatures.
 * Please note that the structure was born during the workshops with different contributions from the students.
 * After five days about 50 creature-classes populated The Abyss.
 * Each creature is a single .PDE file so it was easy to add them to The Abyss (via reflection) and to share them.
 *
 * The rules:
 * Extend the SuperCreature class and build your own creature. 
 * Allowed colors are white with alpha shades. Not a strict rule.
 * Each creature must implement the "move()" and "draw()" methods. (see SuperCreature for details)
 * Transforms should use the pos, rot, sca vectors.
 * Animations can be timed with frames or actual time.
 * The name of the new creature class is built with the authors initals and the creature name; 
 * not an optimal naming convention but it works with 10-20 people.
 * The .pde file must have the same name of the class.
 * example: AGCubus
 * Insert your name, the creature name and the version in the constructor. (To do: annotations?)

h3. Purpose

The idea behind The Abyss project was to build a system and then let everyone contribute, with a good balance between individual and collaborative work. Students could build new creatures or expand features of the abyss itself. For beginners it was easy enough to contribute with a basic creature, more advanced students could train their graphic skills or even build creatures which interacted with other creatures. After several requests I decided to publish the (far from perfect) source code of The Abyss. I left a few of my own example creatures but student’s creatures are not included as I didn't ask their permission to publish the code.

h3. Creature rules

* Extend the SuperCreature class and build your own creature.
* Allowed colors are white with alpha shades. Not a strict rule.
* Each creature must implement the “move()” and “draw()” methods. (see the SuperCreature class for details).
* Transforms should use the pos, rot, sca vectors.
* Animations can be timed with frames or actual time.
* The name of the new creature class is built with the authors initals and the creature name (not an optimal naming convention but it works with 10-20 people).
* The .pde file must have the same name of the class (for example: AGCubus.pde).
* Insert your name, the creature name, the version and the date in the constructor.
